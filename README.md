<h2>Random Walk</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
This is the Random Walk exercise from Week 3 of MIT xPro Coding Bootcamp
<h3>Description</h3>
Animated balls bouncing around a set area.
<h3>Future Plans</h3>
I have no specific plans for the future of this animation outside of general tinkering, though it is a useful reference for DOM interaction.
<h3>Notes</h3>
Much of the initial code was provided as part of the assignment.
